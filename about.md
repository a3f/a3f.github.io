For upkeep, I do embedded Linux development at Siemens’ industrial networking division. I used to study mechanical engineering and mechatronics, but I found it not to be my cup of tee. Now I study computer science at the KIT. In my free time, I feel bad about projects I started and didn’t get around to complete till a state, where uploading them might make sense, which in turn prompts me to start new projects.

Because it makes me sound professional, I'll say that views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily align with those of my employer, my not-yet-alma-mater or anyone else, really. :-)
